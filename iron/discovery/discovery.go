// Package discovery defines the interfaces through which an iron endpoint
// finds and advertises the direct UDP addresses of peers, independently of
// the relay.
//
// A Discoverer lets a dialing endpoint look up a peer's direct addresses from
// some channel other than the relay endpoint store (e.g. future mDNS, a
// directory service, a DHT). An Announcer is the publish side: a place this
// endpoint advertises its own direct addresses so peers can find it.
//
// Announcer deliberately does not embed Discoverer: an endpoint may want to
// announce itself somewhere without discovering others there (and vice
// versa). The two roles are wired separately at endpoint construction
// (WithAnnouncers) and per connection (WithDiscoverers).
//
// This package currently defines only the contracts; concrete channels
// (relay, mDNS, ...) live elsewhere.
